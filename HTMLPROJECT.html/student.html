            <p class="img2">After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills,<br> and my knowledge 
                of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.<br><br>
               Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to
                watch all the recorded videos. They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc. <br><br>
                I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA. <br> <br>
                Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.</p>

                I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student.I joined Tap Academy as a CSR
                 student in the month of February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at 
                 Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts
                 and help in learning programming languages from scratch.</p><br><br>
                <p class="img11">I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap  Academy is 
                structured in a way that makes it easy for  students from all  domains to understand the 
                 concepts and technology taught by the trainers.</p> <br>
                 <p class="img12">Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package <br> of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a 
                    lot in securing this job. <br> <br> Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this <br>opportunity.</p>
